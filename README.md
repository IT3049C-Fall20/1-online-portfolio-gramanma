## Self-Reflection:

Well I finally learned how to use git after years of putting it off/doing it incorrectly.  Overall, it was pretty simple but some of the instructions were incorrect/didn't match up with eachother/outdated. I also wasn't able to "update the assignment checks above to the correct link." I'm not quite sure what this means/where the correct link is as it is not inthe instructions.

Save for "update the assignment checks above to the correct link" I completed all the of assignemnt to the required standards so I would say good 18/20.

UPDATE: I think I figured out what he meant by checks. So I'd say its 20/20 now :).

### How long it took me to finish this?

1 hour.
